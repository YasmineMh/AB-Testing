# A/B Testing

In this project, I'm applying A/B Testing on fake data generated by an SQL script.

In the notebook, I set up and execute A/B tests by calculating metrics from raw datasets, calculating the sample size of an A/B test and applying A/B test analysis process.

## Credits

This project's resources are taken from [A/B Testing in Python](https://365datascience.com/courses/ab-testing-in-python/) course.
